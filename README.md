# the-matrix.js

Configurable JavaScript version of
[the Matrix system failure animation](https://youtu.be/OyRW9uFSmh0).

See [a live demo](https://rokstrnisa.github.io/the-matrix.js/). Click on the
canvas to see a longer animation.

## Features

* Easily configurable, e.g. text, speed, number of highlights, etc.
* Replaces drawn words with similarly-looking, previously-hidden DOM elements
  at the end, which makes it crawler-friendly and useful as an index page.
* Handles window resizing (but stops the animation).
